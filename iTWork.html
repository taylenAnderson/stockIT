    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490</b></p>
    <p>  <b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>So thanks very much for ah coming to the interview today Martin as takes a little time out of your day to do this.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.160</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, so you OK with this being recorded?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.830</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yes, I'm happy for this to be recorded.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.530</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Cool. Uh, are you able to just tell us a bit about your role and what you do?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.880</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Sure, uh at the moment I'm working for MS Queensland in Milton.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:45.280</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>uh, my job role or job title is systems administrator and being a small IT department, the role is quite varied and it's a mixture of primarily looking after these servers and infrastructure, which are Microsoft Windows based.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:00:46.810 --> 00:01:10.540</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Because our company also uses cloud, we look after a number of particular Microsoft Cloud services as well and also look after a bit of backups, hardware and some sort of end user devices such as workstations and mobile phones and support queries that come with that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.470</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Oh cool, cool. and uh, how does that impact the business at MS Queensland in your role in particular?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.970</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Oh look, I mean.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:43.240</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>the way I see IT in general is that it's needed by all businesses to operate without it they can't really operate and but basically the role and means that you know by making by keeping everything up to date and running correctly and</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:01:43.290 --> 00:02:01.020</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>and configuring it, configuring it to look after the business needs and it means that the business is able to run smoothly. So, I sort of see it as being a reasonably important part of the uhm, the operations of the business</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.910</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Oh, thank you. Uh what was it like when you first began working in IT? Do you find it enjoying or challenging?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:39.690</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uh, well look I, I mean I started working out in IT after I… Actually, I started before I left for Uni. I had a couple of part time jobs assembling motherboards and things, but when I really started it was a bit of a jump into the unknown. What you learn at university and what it's like in real life, are two different things and I guess the one thing that I did learn is that what you're reading? Yeah, in textbooks and</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:02:40.520 --> 00:03:21.630</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>And study for and how things actually operated are quite, can be quite different and also the one thing you don't really get told too much about is that the sort of people skills you need, because you're usually, in IT. So, if you're not a programmer, but if you're in like a sysadmin, or you do IT support, you end up sort of interacting with all levels of the business, so you could be talking to the CEO if, if a job comes that way, so yeah, that’s sort of what I, what I’ve found, and compared to what I have studied it, it can be quite different.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.310</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>I definitely agree there, it's uhm, you know, I think there is this, like this stigma that, you know, IT pretty much.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:40.640</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, like very isolated from, from people but that I guess it's not really the case. It's dealing with people on a day-to-day businesses and business and stuff. Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:59.550</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah. Yeah, because everybody's got a device of some sorts or is using some sort of software and when they need assistance using it or if there's a problem with some hardware, they'll soon, they’ll soon come to IT to discuss that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.840</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:15.400</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uh, was there another job in mind, or that you were doing before you got into the IT field? Uh and was there something about the other job or career path that led you into IT or exposure interest into the field?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:46.170</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Ah yeah, look, that's a good question. To tell you the truth, when I was still a student, I kind of didn't have quite a clear idea of what I wanted to do, so I actually did a mixture of business and IT and even during the course then I still wasn't sure. So, when I actually did leave (Uni), my first job was an IT job and it wasn't quite how I perceived it to be, but I stuck with it. So, in all truthfulness since I've left Uni</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:04:46.220 --> 00:05:03.790</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>I've, I've just pretty much been doing, doing IT and yeah. So, if somebody gave me a different role, it wouldn't be, it be, it takes a little bit to get used to. So yeah, look IT has been primarily my, my work since I've finished.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.990</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Cool, cool.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.310</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, do you engage much with the other areas of the business? And if so, what do you discuss with them?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.700</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Ah look, not as much as some previous roles.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:51.450</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>I think usually if there's a project that comes up where another part of the business, whether it's marketing, finance, etc that need something, then there's a higher level of interaction, but at the moment it's very ad hoc so it could be anybody who comes by and asks a question and get some, get some assistance or talk about a particular future project. But yeah, there's not a specific part of the business at the moment that I'm dealing with.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.970</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>With umm, when you're at University, I guess cause obviously technology has changed quite a bit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:18.280</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, you know, with me doing it now anyway, it seems like it's touching on things like artificial intelligence and machine learning, which I think is fairly, fairly new, or I guess it's uh as a bit more of a trend.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.740</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Cutting edge?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:33.140</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, what was it like when you're in Uni? What were some of the, I guess the real new things at the time and how's that sort of shaped the IT space now?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:42.950</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Gosh well, it's ah, this is gonna show my age, but I guess as I was sort of really getting doing IT at Uni</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:06:44.380 --> 00:07:02.720</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>The actual, I think underlying operating system was Linux that was running a lot of the systems for the university and umm when I was there, the command line was still quite popular.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:47.510</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>that I think windows 3.1 or umm was sort of around, and Windows 95 hadn't come out really by then. So, our talk was about, you know, object orientated programming. It was about the graphical user interface, and it was about talking about you know 32-bit programs, 64-bit hadn't really been discussed so that was that was the cutting edge was that I guess it was the GUI. Windows still booted into the command prompt, but then continued onto loading Windows itself before it was MS Dos. So, so yeah, that was that was where all the excitement was at, at the time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:07:48.510 --> 00:08:02.050</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>And umm, with the GUI, I know that uh, obviously back then it was very popular for I guess, you know, users of, I guess, for the main public to get familiar with computers as the command line can be a bit scary, I guess or intimidating.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.780</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:25.960</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>For new users, but I guess now. I guess the GUI for a technician. It creates a lot of space on the, on the memory and hard disk. Is it sort of coming away a bit from the GUI or do you think the GUI is still being pushed?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.880</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uh, oh with the future of the operating systems?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.280</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:53.980</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Oh I think the GUI is here to stay, umm but as you've seen and I've seen, Microsoft found that there was limitations on what the GUI could do. So, they’ve created PowerShell to really assist sort of administrators and people that needed to really control their computers to be much more powerful.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:31.370</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>So I, I still think there's, there's, you know, the GUI will continue to evolve and as Windows 11 is showing and that is always going to be there for either the general end user but the command line will, will always be prominent and I think there are though limitations with the command line and what made the GUI more popular was the fact that unless you know, that unless you know want to type. You never going to be able to do anything with it, so the GUI was, it was inevitable. Yes…</p>
    <p></p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:41.720</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, that's ah that's really good. Uh what, which other aspects of work do you find most challenging within your role?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:09:42.960 --> 00:10:17.650</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Umm, I think it's, it's juggling the multiple tasks with limited resources, whether that's not having the funding for enough hardware available to swap, you know to, to swap things out, whether it's enough software licenses and just how rapidly the businesses is changing but at the same time they they're not supporting IT.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:28.320</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, so I. I feel that that though that's the challenging thing is there's a, there's a lot of business change, but IT is not getting the funding</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:43.220</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>The support that IT needs to, to sort of adapt and grow with the business for IT to be on the forefront rather than on the always on the back foot. So that that's what my perception is.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:55.540</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>I think yeah, it's funny with like I guess. I know there's some people in uni that they come from all different backgrounds and from different careers. And one thing that sort of stood out to me was.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:23.300</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>As they sort of in their prominent roles at time, they've seen how much IT is evolved and now they've, they're really doing uni to sort of learn it, sort of compliment them. It's kind of, even doing a case study the other day on a bank, they they've transformed their model now from “it's not just a bank, but now a Technology company that does banking or specialises banking.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.780</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Right.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:41.100</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>It's kind of. It's funny to see, like maybe that might be something that MS Queensland can perhaps offer or change. Maybe with time or uh, maybe that's a trend that businesses are going towards where they're sort of pushing more or sort of building applications, and I don't know that that's.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.080</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>So uh, what, what do you think on that one? What's your thoughts?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:11:45.170 --> 00:12:14.850</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Ah, oh look. I mean, banks have large resources to fund those kinds of projects. I think something like MS Queensland might decide to produce an application or get a third party to assist with producing an application that might benefit people were in with their MS. I don't, I don't sort of see that happening at the moment but knowing what the nurse call systems are and</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:42.520</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>currently being used and paid for by the company to, to look up to assist people with multiple sclerosis. I think there there's certainly room for improvement there and but yeah, it's, it's difficult to say that MS Queensland would have that kind of appetite to produce its own software or become a sort of software led house at this stage, I think they've got some more growing to do before they, they look at that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.810</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uh, in what aspects about your job that you find most award rewarding?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:12:51.100 --> 00:13:21.770</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Ah, good question. I think that there's a certain level of freedom even though we can use change requests that, that you “know you're the things that you're doing”, that they're actually benefiting the company and obviously the end users are the client, the staff, and the people with MS, so where some jobs always feels like you're pushing a pen around, this one you can.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:53.470</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>You can put forward suggestions to improve either the software being used, or the way that the end users are interacting with their workstations or devices, and they get listened to, and you know, usually if there is, there's the costs is negligible or none, and it can be supported properly then there's usually an agreement quite quickly to say, yeah we can. We can do that that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.340</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>That looks like a good suggestion. So yeah, being listened to by the company and by the IT team is, is great.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:16.400</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>that that's one thing. There's nothing. There's nothing better than creating something I think, and that that's certainly what we're able to, to achieve in this role.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:26.500</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Mmm, that's cool. And like you get, so I guess that's sort of yeah, you get to see that the technology. Sort of I guess helps there. I guess they work as well</p>

    <p>Uhm yeah cool.</p>

  <div class="white">

    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, are you able to share an example of some of the work that best captures the essence of your role?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:14:37.440 --> 00:15:03.040</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>The work? Oh gosh, well, if I thought verbally I don't, I'll have to… I think when there were things that I sort of achieved when I came in that I feel shows that would be the, when all the desktops and laptops were sort of running and the mobile phone…</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:44.950</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>So basically, the end user devices were set up and configured, they were all working, you know, reasonably well, but there was a lot of the management of them, the software and that they're just the general administration of them was a little out of date, so luckily the business allowed us to buy some better Microsoft licensing, which then allowed us to or allowed me to look at moving the devices from just a central computer that managed them into like a Microsoft Cloud based service called “Intune”.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:15:45.020 --> 00:16:12.350</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>and when I think back to when I first started. Some sort of testing it out and seeing what it, what it could do to what it does now. It's become quite like an essential tool to, to manage the machines to deploy software and configuration, and to just keep an eye on what those machines are doing and the Windows updates there was. So now they're, they're more compliant and more standard with Microsoft practices.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:36.240</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>So yeah, to me that, that tool now has become, certainly from my point of view quite an essential tool to ensure that people have an up-to-date Windows operating system, or a managed Android phone and we can just yeah, manage and administer it much better than we could before.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.610</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Ah Brilliant, yeah. It's crazy. We've just learned about cloud in our uni studies.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:55.060</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uh, could you tell us a bit about… ah obviously, I think from memory or is it cloud that was sort of around since 2008 by AWS?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:08.060</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uh, I guess what was it like… were you around when servers, before servers began to be virtualized on computing? Or they, that sort of always been around?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:40.910</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uh well, like I mean AWS sort have, well I was working in IT and you know you started to hear people talking about it and how, I mean, Amazon Web Services came about because they, they realize they had so much compute power still available that they could maybe offer it to customers as a as a way of them offloading some of their on-premises stuff to work on their servers and the whole name of cloud kind of came about, and</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.170</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>oh, I don't know that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:17:42.690 --> 00:18:09.490</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, yeah. I think they just yeah, Amazon obviously had the expertise, and they had the data centres around which were primarily for just optimizing their Amazon website and their back end and they just use that too, then start to offer it to business customers so I guess, sort of seeing the change was</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:39.410</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>where you started to hear businesses talking about “We're going to”, you know there was the big data talk and all of that was where you know businesses realized they had a limitation on how much they could keep on their on-prem and then there was and I think it will kind of coincided with the having, you know, the cost of having a dedicated Internet line and Ethernet to  a data centre just so</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:18:40.090 --> 00:19:03.390</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>because of obviously businesses could move their computers away from the office and put them in a data centre and then it was kind of a natural progression once the back end, once the Internet back end improved and the speeds were there that they could start to maybe move more things away from on-premises where there was that that ongoing cost of looking after the data centre.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:33.490</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, and knew the risk around, the risk around there being outages, as I, sort of saw in someone I used to work for at Sun Super that they had problems with the flood, the big floods and it caused a lot of issues for them. So, I think there was the appetite from that point on to like go “OK, let's, let's see what we can move off the on-premises the into the cloud because Amazon is now offering it” though</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:58.020</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Microsoft was a little bit late to the party and some businesses I noticed were reluctant to go over to Amazon because it was quite a different level of expertise needed for that and there was nothing until Microsoft brought out, I think when they brought out, you know, moving your emails off (to O365) that’s when people really started to look at the Microsoft products.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.010</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uhm, and you know Amazon was obviously still offering it, specialized services as well. So yeah, I think that you know “Them seeing it” has made a real difference, I think nearly every business have wanted to move more and more things away, but I remember there being a sense of fear with my colleagues because they were concerned that they were going to lose their jobs</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:25.030</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>ah, yep.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:46.940</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>because if they move to the cloud, why do they need any of these people to look after servers and things like that, so that's what I kind of experienced, but so far I think it's just meant that everybody’s role has changed so you need to understand and be able to use the cloud services and yeah, that’s what I, That’s what I’ve noticed in my time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:55.430</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>And uh, has using the cloud technologies, has that made your life easier as a systems administrator?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:17.800</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, I, I think so. Umm, we as sysadmins had to spend so much time out of hours patching servers and building new servers, but thankfully with virtualization that helped lot as well. So, outages you, you could have enough hardware so you could kind of build, build your hardware up without losing</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:47.630</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>The end user losing any sort of that time with access to those systems so seeing, seeing the changes has made it made it sort of easier because the, I guess in a way, the responsibility for some of that has now moved off the sysadmin shoulders and onto the cloud provider and as the cloud provider has more redundancy and they've got more expertise</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:21:48.630 --> 00:22:07.370</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>In every single facet in their data centres, it means it takes a bit of the sort of weekly daily maintenance away, routine away from the sysadmin so that they can concentrate on other projects. Other services that are running.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:26.660</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>So I think it's been a, it's been a good thing that that there's less time needed to be spent on just general patching and updating on their servers, operating system, and even, even just like the databases and ah, yeah, the hardware.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.360</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Cool, yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:47.790</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Uh, one last question too uh, where do you see the trend of computers and technology is going towards? Does this Excite you? Or makes you worried a bit about the future? Just before the, you know everything going virtualized and moving to the cloud, you know, I guess you know when you look at shows like Mr Robot.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.300</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.750</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Cyber-attacks, so, what's your opinion on that?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:22:53.220 --> 00:23:24.890</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>oh look, it’s interesting that you mention Mr Robot. I think there's quite a bit of fact based in, in those, in that show and I think there's, I think there's going to be a day where, there's going to be that you know, there's always going to be risk when you're getting more connected, but everything is getting more connected and I think that there's going to be a day where there's going to be some big outage on mobile phones, I can see that coming</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:55.490</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>I think there's going to be some great things where the computers will be, you know, like they've been, already been used, you know, in sort of intelligence to build better CPUs so that the computers themselves are using AI to assist with that and I'm sure that that's helping with building better if more efficient data centres. I think the world needs, needs to sort of have more, more kind of intelligence from AI and, and that, because I think the world is</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:10.380</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>in a bit of a mess in terms of the environment and that, and we, we need, you know, seeing Covid and obviously the only reason we could get the vaccine was because of the, the raw compute power that was there to, to kind of come up with some, some</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.930</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Oh I did not know that, that's crazy!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:48.080</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, you know that, that could’ve been the only reason there could have been developed that quickly was because they could throw it into some cloud based, you know, systems that could crunch the data very quickly, umm so I think that there's some great things that they're going to come for it and I think the pace is just going to continue, and I think the price ,once we get over the Covid short, the costs of the, the sort of hardware components at the moment in a couple years, I think   there's, you know, technology is just going to continue to be cheaper and when you look at what a smart watch can do now, so I ,I think there's going to be more</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:24:48.310 --> 00:25:00.920</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Uhm connection with, with what's out there, any device you know you're gonna sort of get a receipt and it's going to be a small receipt or it will be kind of connected to the Internet, something they'll be something like that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:30.960</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>umm I, I think there's gotta be, I'm concerned about how people are becoming so tide to their, their mobile phones, their smartwatches to their devices that there, there’s sort of society and the way it interacts with each other and the way that sort of like there's that misinformation and all the, there's the good side of something like social media but there's also the bad side, so I think it's going to be</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:47.540</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>there's going to be growing pains, but there will be more rules around it just like the Internet was like the Wild West when it first became popular and used more and everybody could do everything. There's going to be more policing around all their software services and</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:25:48.330 --> 00:26:02.050</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>things such as, you know, social media but I think it's, it's exciting times but how people are going to balance it with reality interacting with the technology and interacting with reality? I think that's where I’m unbothered.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.330</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>I'm, that’s what I’m concerned about. Not, not to worry about Skynet just yet.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:22.940</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah, I guess that's, that's one thing that gets me really worried, but you know, like, I think one thing, I'm always thinking about is before these systems go into the cloud, like what happens if some malicious, you know software gets</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:32.380</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>I mean it, it would be hard for it to do, I'm sure. Yeah, I mean all it takes is malicious software to, you know, enter like, let's say Google's data centre and just sort of start, you know.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:42.780</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Propagating against their, their systems and you know, like take a big portion of the Internet down, and I guess something that on the Internet. Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.100</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.110</b></p>
    <p><b>Brandon McPherson</b></p>
    <p>Yeah.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.800</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>It's relied on so much just like the, the other day, there was that DNS error</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:26:51.830 --> 00:27:21.060</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>and then it's caused Facebook and Instagram and everything to go down and you know, so many organisations rely on Facebook to communicate with people. So, it, it does make you know it doesn't make me realize, make businesses hopefully realize that they can't just rely on one form of, you know, they can't put all their eggs in one basket that that's the quickest way to sum it up. because if they do, there's going to be these outages, even Microsoft services, you know, we experienced those once in a while service degradation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:43.490</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>service degradation with, with their products so yeah, yeah, a business, I think and people just should not always rely, you should always assume that maybe all those photos you've got backed up to the cloud. I've got my photos on three different providers so that if one goes, if Google goes, I’ve got Amazon Glacier or I've got Microsoft one drive.</p>

    <p>Yes.</p>

    <p>So uh, what do you, just really quickly. What's your thoughts about the evolution of human ethics with, with computers and the privacy and stuff?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.460</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>Ah yeah, look well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:16.990</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>We, when we joined Gmail or joining Google, get a Google account or Microsoft, we're already agreeing to some, some quite, you know questionable I guess</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:47.190</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>legislative, not legislation but rules within, within the user terms and conditions. I think the governments have got to keep on top of it because you know, they're the Google and Microsoft and, and Apple and so on all scraping our data and collecting it so they already have a large pool. Even though they say synonymized large pullover information, but we've just got, I think you just have to accept if you say something</p>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p style="text-align:center;"><b>00:28:47.240 --> 00:29:24.300</b></p>
    <p><b>Martin Harrington</b></p>
    <p>if you put something on the Internet, you know, just accept that, that could be used against you. It could be copied, so just, you just have to be mindful of that and I think no matter what rules the government put in place, there's, and even if the businesses abide by them, all it takes is a breach and all your data or some of your data is out there. So, Just yeah, I think you just gotta be guarded and make sure you've got paper copies of things and accept that what you’ve put out there,  could you know, have sensitivities. You just gotta be careful.</p>
