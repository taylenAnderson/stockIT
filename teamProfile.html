    <h3>Team Profile</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="white">
    <p>The test outcomes for our members are tabled and summarised below.</p>
    <p>The followings are snapshots of who we are as a team.</p>
    <br>
    <p>• We are more <b>introverted</b> than <i>extraverted.</i></p>
    <p>• We are more <b>intuitive</b> than <i>observant.</i></p>
    <p>• We are more <b>logical</b> than <i>emotional</i> thinkers.</p>
    <p>• We are equally <b>decisive and flexible.</b></p>
    <p>• We are more <b>self-assured and even-tempered</b> than <i>self-conscious and sensitive.</i></p>
    <p>• We tend to <b>learn by doing & seeing</b> rather than <i>listening.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>Information obtained from test results is helpful to facilitate the group’s collaboration. For example, our test results demonstrate our introverted nature. It took two online meetings before we determine our roles and the leadership to make visible progress with the assessment. This may be an example of the introverted nature of the team working against us. If we shared this information before the meeting, we may have acted differently.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A good aspect of our team might be that we think logically, this means that we know the consequences if we do not collaborate and execute our plan properly. Therefore, after the first two meetings, we quickly realised that it was in our best interest for the team to work together and complete the tasks.</p>
    <p>The test results also helped us to decide how to deal with each member. Everyone has their own strength and weaknesses. Knowing them would positively influence the way we interact with each other. We understand that acknowledging the individual differences is a good starting point to collaborate and proceed with our team project. </p>
