<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%"><span lang="en-US">Here
you should give as much detail as you can about what your project
will do, and how you will do it. This should also include how far you
have got with developing any features or outcomes from your project.
Tell us about the &ldquo;story&quot; of your project &ndash; how it
began, how it has progressed, and what stage of the plan you are up
to. Include any dead-ends you may have followed, decisions made, and
changes that have been made to the project plan. This will need to
include a significant amount of detail, so that it is easily seen
what precisely you have done and are planning to do. If it helps,
imagine the information that would be required if you were to hand
this project over at the end of the semester to a new team to
complete the job. What would you want to know, if you were one of the
people taking over? There is no set length for this section, but it
is hard to believe that less than two pages could be adequate. Three
or four pages is far more likely.</span></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%"><font color="#1f3864"><span lang="en-US">Another
difficult aspect of project planning is knowing how much time to
allow. You will have something like 36 hours per person for this
assignment. In order to develop a plan for further work beyond the
end of this course, let us assume that you will have an extra 10
hours per week per person for 10 weeks in addition to this time in
order to develop your project. This means that you will have six
weeks (Weeks 7 to 12) of the semester to work on your assignment,
with a further 10 weeks after that. This means that your plan will be
for a total of 15 weeks, with the first 6 being on this assignment. </span></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%"><font color="#1f3864"><span lang="en-US">You
will clearly not have the extra 10 weeks to work on the project; this
is intended to give you a feeling for how much you would be able to
achieve in that time. This means that the first 6 weeks of your
timeline will end up being your actually progress on this project,
with the remaining 10 weeks being your plan for the next stages. </span></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%"><font color="#1f3864"><span lang="en-US">This
should be presented in the form of a table, with one row for each
week, specifying as best you can the work for each person for each
week.  This means that the first six rows of the table will describe
your progress so far, and the remaining 10 your best guess at how the
remaining time would work. </span></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%"><font color="#1f3864"><span lang="en-US">This
will no doubt change as you work on your assignment, as it will give
you a more precise idea about how long it will take to get things
done. This is not an unchangeable contract for exactly how things
will work; that is unrealistic for just about any project. The idea
is to get you thinking about how exactly your time should be
allocated to the various tasks involved. It is a good idea to have a
milestone (i.e. a specific outcome) for each week of the project.
This may include getting familiar with tools, or reading up on a
particular technique or technology. You should also include time for
writing up the final report and any other documentation. Writing
reports always takes longer than you think, especially as you should
expect to re-write any piece of writing that you do at least three or
four times. </span></font>
